Money Idle Simulator where the primary goal is to manage JPY across multiple income-generating and obligatory accounts. Key features include passive growth in the Invest Account (1.3% per 30s) and high-risk/high-reward investment options like the Stock Account (5x growth after 6 hours) and various Business Accounts offering escalating returns (1-30% profit every 3 or 6 minutes) but incurring deposit fees and a 20% withholding tax. The simulator also features a volatile Cryptocurrency Exchange allowing trade of ETH, BTC, and USDT against JPY, where rates fluctuate every minute. Finally, maintaining liquidity is crucial due to strict, time-locked obligations: an 80% Tax every 5 minutes, a large BIR Payment every 5 hours, and a smaller Bank Payment every hour, alongside an option to contribute 99% of main cash to a trackable Government Ledger.
